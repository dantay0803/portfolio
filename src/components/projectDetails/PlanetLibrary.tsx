          Planet Library was my main responsibility while working at Solus UK
          Ltd. It was being developed as a child-focused version of Solus'
          flagship library application. Features of the application include
          searching and reserving physical and electronic content. Other library
          features include a digital library card, view return dates and view
          upcoming events.

          To help drive regular foot traffic to the libraries. The application
          features an augmented reality character hunt. Which allows users to
          catch over 100 characters that gains them tokens to unlock games.
