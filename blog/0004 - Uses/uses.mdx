After reading [this post](https://wesbos.com/uses/) from Wes Bos on what hardware and software he uses and then discovering on Twitter he has a [collection of similar posts](https://uses.tech/) from other developers. Which he has now turned into a dedicated website using Gatsby. I thought it would be enjoyable to do one of my own, just covering what tools I use when developing personal projects.

## Editors, Terminal & Browser

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – This is my editor of choice when it comes to creating anything JavaScript, HTML and React related.

The plugins I use include:

- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

- [VS Code Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)
- [VS Code Styled Components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components)

[Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) – This is my go-to editor for any of my C# based work. I know you can use VS Code for C# as well, but I feel more at home with Visual Studio and its C# experience is better.

[Fira Code](https://www.github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) – In both VS Code and VS Studio I use Fira Code as my font of choice.

[Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) – I recently switched over to using the new Windows Terminal as my terminal of choice.

[Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/) – At the time of writing this blog I have recently switched from using Chrome to Firefox as my daily browser and I am currently really enjoying the features it brings.

## Desktop Programs

[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) – Allows you to easily and quickly mockup design ideas. You can also find projects of prebuilt components from the likes of Google that you can use.

[Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/) – For when I need to do some very light image editing.

[OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) – Another piece of software I have recently started using and have fallen in love with for taking notes and scribbling down ideas.

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) – A Nice powerful editor that you can do a lot with. Whether it be coding or just simple text editing, which is my main use.

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) – May be blasphemy to some, but it is very quick and easy to use and since I am just working on tutorials and side projects it does the job for me.

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) – For viewing API calls

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) – Screen capture.

[DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/uk/products/davinciresolve/) – Video editing.

## Web Apps

[Google Docs](https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/) – To me this is a great free alternative to MS Office, I use sheets the most for saving tutorial links and project ideas.

[JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/) – Great online JSON formatter and editor.

[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) – Easy way to get clean screenshots of code snippets

[1Password](https://1password.com/) – Password manager
